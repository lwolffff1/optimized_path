# Shortest Path Algorithms (Dijkstra & A*)

This is a Python project that demonstrates shortest path finding using **Dijkstra's algorithm** (for general weighted graphs) and **A\*** (for grid maps with heuristics).  
It includes a command-line interface (CLI), unit tests, and example datasets.


Usage: 
1. Run Dijkstra on a general graph
2. Run A* on a grid with Manhattan heuristic
